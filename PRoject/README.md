# 📖 IoT Smart Ventilation – Theory Notes

## 🔹 Introduction
Our system is designed to **improve indoor air quality** by using IoT + sensors.  
It checks **temperature, humidity, and air quality** → then controls fans/vents.

---

## 🔹 Sensors Used
- 🌡️ **DHT11/DHT22** → Temperature + Humidity  
- 🏭 **MQ135** → Air Quality (smoke, CO2, gases)  

---

## 🔹 Working
1. Sensors detect environment conditions.  
2. Data goes to **Arduino/ESP32**.  
3. If air/temp/humidity is bad → fan/vent ON.  
4. Data can also be displayed on web dashboard.  

---

## 🔹 Applications
- Homes, offices  
- Hospitals, labs  
- Schools, industries  

---

## 🔹 Future Improvements
- Add **mobile app**  
- AI predictions for air quality  
- Solar powered system
